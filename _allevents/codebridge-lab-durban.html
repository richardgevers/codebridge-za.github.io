			<h2>Codebridge lab: Durban</h2>
			<h4><span class="label label-success">September 1 @ 18:00 - 21:00</span></h4>
			<p>Codebridge Lab allows civic-minded folks to come together and ‘hack’ some really cool projects. These projects could be anything from a website that has a live visualisation of the city budget, to a public transport app for durban, to a news article on housing shortages. We nurture data-driven storytelling, where data scientists can team up with journalists to explore and expand stories together.</p>

			<p>These evenings are a little different to our usual meetups, in that this is about actually getting our hands dirty with open data and civic technology and hacking, writing, visualising, developing, and creating on the night. Before each meeting, you will be asked to specify which project you will be hacking and naturally everyone will bring laptops and whatever other tools are needed for their projects.
			People of all backgrounds/skill levels are welcome!</p>

			<p>RSVP your attendance to <a href="mailto:nk@opendata.durban">nk@opendata.durban</a>.</p>
